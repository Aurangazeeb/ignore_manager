# Project Root Artifact Review

## Recommended .gitignore rules
- [ ] node_modules/ # Node.js dependencies directory, generated by npm/yarn, should not be committed.
- [ ] __pycache__/ # Python bytecode cache files, generated automatically.
- [ ] dist/ # Build output directory, generated during build process.

## Recommended .dockerignore rules
- [ ] node_modules/ # This can be installed during the Docker build, ignoring reduces image size.
- [ ] __pycache__/ # Not needed in production container, reduces image size.
- [ ] dist/ # If builds are done in the container, exclude local build outputs to avoid redundancy.
